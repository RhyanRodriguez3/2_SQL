<br />

The language is broken down from statement, clauses, and key words.

I am increasing my technical skills and documenting. Currently, <br />

- I feel comfortable reading the language and vaguely understand what's happening on the back end.
- I feel comfortable with data cleansing from YT tutorials exposure.

- The goal is to get up and walking, then when I'm in the environment I can get to running. So I have to get used to problems. WHAT I HAVE TO GET USED TO RN is attempting to solve problems with vague ass direcitons. I can do this through YT tutorials. I should find YT tutorials which go over questions you'd ask in real life of the data and then I know how to
