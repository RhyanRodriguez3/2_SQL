# **SQL Guide**
SQL is a programming language used to manipulate data and the database. RDBMS such as Oracle and MS SQL Server have different versions of SQL. 
<br />

Relational databases organize data into tables. Tables have columns and rows. Columns establish attributes (data types) and rows are records (data points). Primary tables have a primary key that connect to foreign key(s) from fact tables. Primary keys establish one to many relationships.
<br />

The language is broken down from statement, clauses, and key words.

In a data engineer role, the hardest part is data cleansing because I need the technical aptitude to tell sql what I want it to do. I want to have full control of the language to manipulate data. I want to know how to create my own syntax to solve problems. 
Currently, <br />

- I feel comfortable with reading the language and vaguely understand what's happening on the back end.
- I feel comfortable with data cleansing. These came from YT tutorials exposure.
- I'm not used to translating problems to SQL queries. What can help me with that? 
- If I got my own dataset, it would help me craft data that execs might want to see. I think that's the best I can do at this point. The goal is to get up and walking, then when I'm at the environment I can get to running. So I have to get used to problems. WHAT I HAVE TO GET USED TO RN is attempting to solve problems with vague ass direcitons. I can do this through YT tutorials.
